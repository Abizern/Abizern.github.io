I am a freelance iOS and macOS developer in London. Currently *available* for new contracts.

I write modern, maintainable code in Swift@@html:{{<marginnote>}}Of course, I can hurt myself in other languages, but this is what I use professionally{{</marginnote>}}@@ using SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit and a whole lotta love.

I've given talks across the UK and internationally@@html:{{<sidenote>}}Excuse the humblebrag{{</sidenote>}}@@ and you can see a list of some of them [[/talks][here]]

I organise the monthly [[https://nscodernightlondon.com][NSCoder Night London]] meetup where iOS and macOS developers meet to chat and share knowledge and experience. This went into hiatus during the Pandemic, but we managed to keep it going by having remote meetings.

You can see my older posts at my previous site [[https://abizern.org][abizern.org]], but I'm going to keep this one just for development related topics.
