Notes on Advent of Code 2024 Day 2
#+end_description

Today's challenge was only slightly more complicated than yesterday's, and one where brute(ish) force was enough. My solution is on Github{{{sidenote(https://github.com/Abizern/aoc-swift-2024/blob/main/Sources/Day02.swift)}}}.

*** Part 1
To check if a report (a list of numbers) is safe; see if they are all increasing or all decreasing and the difference is inclusively between 1 and 3.

I used the =adjacentPairs()= method from the Swift-Algorithms package{{{sidenote(https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms)}}} rather than =zip= to get a sequence of pairs of numbers.

After checking whether the differences should be increasing or decreasing, I made sure that all the pairs satisfied the condition by using the =allSatisfy()= method.

#+begin_src swift
  func isSafe(_ report: [Int]) -> Bool {
    guard let start = report.first,
          let end = report.last,
          start != end
    else { return false }
    let shouldIncrease = start < end ? true : false

    return report.adjacentPairs().allSatisfy { a, b in
      (shouldIncrease ? a < b : a > b) && (1 ... 3).contains(abs(a - b))
    }
  }
#+end_src

I used this to filter and count the input to get my answer.

*** Part 2
To check if a report is correctable, see if removing a single number from the list makes it safe. After a few minutes thought about complexity, I used a brute(ish) force solution.

If a report is not safe, I removed one of the numbers and checked again:

#+begin_src
  func isSafeOrCorrectable(_ report: [Int]) -> Bool {
    guard !isSafe(report) else { return true }
    let length = report.count
    var i = 0
    var correctable = false

    while i < length, !correctable {
      var arr = report
      arr.remove(at: i)
      correctable = isSafe(arr)
      i += 1
    }

    return correctable
  }
#+end_src

And, again, a filter and count gives my the answer.

*** Complexity
My completely unscientific assessment of the complexity of removing an element and checking the array again:

The =adjacentPairs()= method has $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity, and I'm going through the elements in a single pass which is $\mathcal{O}(n)$

Removing and checking the list again means another  $\mathcal{O}(n)$ operation, taking it up to  $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, which is not good, but at least it's not exponential.

Looking at the full problem input there are 1000 lines, each with around 10-ish numbers. Each line will require about 100 to 1000 operations. So the full input is around 1 million operations; not a lot.

So, no need to do anything clever, and my solutions are still output in milliseconds.

Notes on Advent of Code 2024 Day 1
#+end_description
Advent of Code{{{sidenote(https://adventofcode.com)}}} is an advent calendar of programming problems created by Eric Wastl{{{sidenote(http://was.tl)}}}.

I've normally done these in languages that I don't use for work --- Common-lisp and Haskell. This year I am going to concentrate on using my primary language of Swift.

I created a template package{{{sidenote(https://github.com/Abizern/swift-aoc-starter-template)}}}, based on one provided by Apple, for Swift solutions.

As expected the first day's problem is fairly easy and a way to make sure that one's environment is set up correctly and works.

This is the 10th anniversary event, and since it involves a missing historian, I think there may be throwbacks to problems from previous years.

*** Parsing 
Parsing the data was nothing special: The input consisted of two numbers on a line, separated by three spaces. Each number represented an entry on the two lists so created a local variable that just returned the two lists. This follow my philosophy of not doing too much to the input for part1 because you don't know what you'll need for part2

*** Part 1
The problem is to find the difference between terms in the sorted list and sum them. The example showed that the differences were the absolute differences.

To get the solution quickly I did the natural thing of sorting the two lists, mapping the differences and summing them:

#+begin_src swift
  func part1() async throws -> Int {
    // lists is an ([Int], [Int]) of the input
    zip(lists.0.sorted(), lists.1.sorted()).map { left, right in
      abs(left - right)
    }
    .reduce(0, +)
  }
#+end_src

After I managed to solve both parts I came back to this and tried something different: rather than sorting the lists, I used the Heap structure from the Swift-Collections package{{{sidenote(https://github.com/apple/swift-collections)}}}. I initialised two heaps and used the =removeMin()= method on each to successively get the smallest value from each list:

#+begin_src swift
  func part1() async throws -> Int {
    let (left, right) = lists
    var leftHeap = Heap(left)
    var rightHeap = Heap(right)

    var result: Int = 0
    while !leftHeap.isEmpty && !rightHeap.isEmpty {
      result += abs(leftHeap.removeMin() - rightHeap.removeMin())
    }

    return result
  }
#+end_src

This may have been slightly faster.

*** Part 2
This part required counting the number of occurrences of each number in the second list. Since I had to use this as a lookup table I created a dictionary by using the handy initialiser on =Dictionary= that takes a grouping. For example, given the example list of =[4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]= we can get a dictionary of the groupings with:

#+begin_src swift
  Dictionary(grouping: input, by: { $0 })
  // -> [3: [3, 3, 3], 9: [9], 5: [5], 4: [4]]
#+end_src

and by mapping the values to counts we can get a lookup table for the frequencies:

#+begin_src swift
  Dictionary(grouping: input, by: { $0 }).mapValues(\.count)
  // -> [4: 1, 9: 1, 5: 1, 3: 3]
#+end_src

After that it's just a case of calculating the values and summing them, which I did in a single reduce:

#+begin_src swift
  func part2() async throws -> Int {
    let (left, right) = lists
    let counts = Dictionary(grouping: right, by: { $0 }).mapValues(\.count)

    let simililarities = left.reduce(into: 0) { partialResult, l in
      let n = counts[l, default: 0]
      partialResult += l * n
    }

    return simililarities
  }
#+end_src

The full solution is available on Github{{{sidenote(https://github.com/Abizern/aoc-swift-2024/blob/main/Sources/Day01.swift)}}}.

A simple puzzle that let me test my Swift environment, and this blog.

** Zip a Collection of Publishers                            :combine:swift:
:PROPERTIES:

#+begin_description
I wrote a publisher that takes an array of publishers and produces a single publisher of the array of their outputs.
#+end_description

I{{{marginnote(This was originally published on my old site at [abizern.org](https://abizern.org))}}} have an array of publishers: =[Publisher<Data, Error>]= and want a publisher of the array of their outputs: =Publisher<[Data], Error>=. The Combine framework provides the =Zip= family of publishers which only go up to 4 inputs so this won't suit my needs. I'm going to write about the steps I took to create a publisher that does what I want.

This seems like a daunting task. There is a blog post about creating a [[https://danieltull.co.uk/blog/2019/08/04/combine-latest-collection/][Combine Latest publisher]] which does something similar to what I needed. I could have used that publisher, but I wanted to be more explicit that this was a =Zip= type of publisher not a =CombineLatest= type of publisher.

At a recent [[https://nscodernightlondon.com][NSCoder Night]]{{{sidenote(A monthly meetup of iOS and macOS developers)}}}, [[https://twitter.com/danielctull][Daniel]] helped me write a publisher that fetched all the pages of a paginated URL. From talking to him and referring to his write up I came to realise that creating a publisher is basically like following a recipe. And more importantly it's not the Publisher that does the work: when a publisher receives a subscription, it creates an internal =Subscription= object which it returns to the subscriber. It is this Subscription object which actually does the work.

*** Why do I Need my Own Publisher?
For an app that I am developing for a client I fetch 24 images from 24 different URLs. I need all the images, and I need them to be ordered for the resulting object that I create to be considered complete. I want to be able to write a chain a like this at the call site:

#+begin_src swift 
  urls                  // [String]
    .map(convertToURL)  // [URL]
    .map(loadURL)       // [Publisher<Data, Error>]
    .zip                // Publisher<[Data], Error>
    .sink {...}         // Consume [Data] or handle the error
#+end_src

*** Why Zip and not CombineLatest?
As the array of publishers that I have are one-shot publishers, I /could/ use the CombineLatest publisher described in the post above. There is a difference between CombineLatest and Zip. Diagrams make this clearer.

@@html:{{< figure
  src="/img/2019/09/CombineLatest.png"
  title="Marble diagram of CombineLatest"
  label="combine-latest-marble-diagram"
  caption="The _latest_ outputs of the publishers"

  title="Marble diagram of Zip"
  label="zip-marble-diagram"
  caption="Publishes _pairs_ of outputs."
  attr=""
  link="/img/2019/09/Zip.png"
>}}@@

I chose to write the Zip publisher because conceptually, I want to wait for all the matched outputs and using a Zip makes this requirement explicit. And, I wanted an excuse to write a publisher.

*** Writing the Publisher

**** Step 1:
Create a struct which defines its =Output= and =Failure= matched to the /upstream/ =Output= and =Failure=.

Let's start with the Publisher itself. Publishers are =struct=s. In my case it's just a container to hold the array of publishers so I constrain the generic type to be a collection of publishers. I also typealias the Output to be an array of the upstream publisher's Outputs and the Failure to be the upstream publisher's Failure type.

#+begin_src swift
  public struct ZipCollection<Publishers>
    where
    Publishers: Collection,
    Publishers.Element: Publisher
  {
    public typealias Output = [Publishers.Element.Output]
    public typealias Failure = Publishers.Element.Failure

    private let publishers: Publishers

    public init(_ publishers: Publishers) {
      self.publishers = publishers
    }
  }
#+end_src

**** Step 2:
Make this struct conform to =Publisher= matching the =Output= and =Failure= to the /downstream/ =Input= and =Failure=.

Add an extension to make =ZiCollection= conform to =Publisher= and implement the required method. This will not compile yet, because the =Subscription= type hasn't been defined. Note that I'm constraining the downstream =Output= and =Failure= to =Zip='s =Output= and =Failure=. The method simply creates a =Subscription= object and passes it along to the subscriber.

#+begin_src swift
  extension ZipCollection: Publisher {
    public func receive<Subscriber>(subscriber: Subscriber)
      where
      Subscriber: Combine.Subscriber,
      Subscriber.Failure == Failure,
      Subscriber.Input == Output
    {
      let subscription = Subscription(subscriber: subscriber, publishers: publishers)
      subscriber.receive(subscription: subscription)
    }
  }
#+end_src 

**** Step 3:
Create a =Subscription= object to return to the downstream subscribers that does the work of transforming the /upstream/ =Output= and =Failure= to the /downstream/ =Input= and =Failure=

#+begin_src swift
  extension ZipCollection {
    fileprivate final class Subscription<Subscriber>: Combine.Subscription
    where
  Subscriber: Combine.Subscriber,
    Subscriber.Failure == Failure,
    Subscriber.Input == Output
    {
      private let subscribers: [AnyCancellable]
      private let queues: [Queue<Publishers.Element.Output>]
    
      init(subscriber: Subscriber, publishers: Publishers) {
        var count = publishers.count
        var outputs = publishers.map { _ in Queue<Publishers.Element.Output>() }
        queues = outputs
        var completions = 0
        var hasCompleted = false
        let lock = NSLock()
      
        subscribers = publishers.enumerated().map { index, publisher in
          publisher.sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
            lock.lock()
            defer { lock.unlock() }
          
            guard case .finished = completion else {
              // Any failure causes the entire subscription to fail.
              subscriber.receive(completion: completion)
              hasCompleted = true
              outputs.forEach { queue in
                queue.removeAll()
              }
              return
            }
          
            completions += 1
          
            guard completions == count else { return }
          
            subscriber.receive(completion: completion)
            hasCompleted = true
          }, receiveValue: { value in
            lock.lock()
            defer { lock.unlock() }
          
            guard !hasCompleted else { return }
            outputs[index].enqueue(value)
          
            guard (outputs.compactMap{ $0.peek() }.count) == count else { return }
          
            _ = subscriber.receive(outputs.compactMap({ $0.dequeue() }))
          })
        }
      }
    
      public func cancel() {
        subscribers.forEach { $0.cancel() }
        queues.forEach { $0.removeAll() }
      }
    
      public func request(_ demand: Subscribers.Demand) {}
    }
  }
#+end_src

This is a bit more code, because this is where the actual work is being done.

The only property is an array of =AnyCancellable= which is used to handle the output of the upstream array of publishers. The =init= method configures each of these to handle the output of the upstream publishers. I use a `Queue` to hold on to the received values, and when at least one value has been received from each of the publishers, I dequeue those results and send them on to the downstream subscriber as an array.

I handle cancellation by sending a =cancel()= message to each of the =Cancellables=.

As I'm not handling back pressure there is an empty implementation of the required =request(_)= method.

*** Make it Chainable
That's it for the publisher. The only thing left to do is to write some conveniences to allow it to be used with chaining syntax. That's quite simple:

#+begin_src swift
extension Collection where Element: Publisher {
    /// Combine the array of publishers to give a single array of the `Zip ` of their outputs
    public var zip: ZipCollection<Self> {
        ZipCollection(self)
    }
}
#+end_src

*** Closing Thoughts
Is this as efficient as Combine's =Zip= functions? I Don't know. At the call site it's a lot easier to use this rather than trying to turn 24 requests into 6 batches of =Zip4= then a =Zip3= and then a =Zip2= to chain all 24 requests together (I know, because that was what I started to write). So it solves the problem I had in a way that I wanted to write the code. Also, the more of these that I write, the more comfortable I get writing them, which is another benefit.

*** Edit
Thanks to [[https://twitter.com/_iains][Iain Smith]] who messaged me to point out that cancellation didn't clear out the queues I've made some minor corrections to the code.

*** Code Repository
The code for this is available as part of the [[https://github.com/CombineHarvesters/FoundationCombine][FoundationCombine]] Swift Package available on GitHub. Alongside the =CombineLatest= publisher which inspired it.

Sometimes it's better to answer the actual, unspoken question
#+end_description

On{{{marginnote(This was originally published on my old site at [abizern.org](https://abizern.org))}}} New Year's eve, Dámasa asked me to calculate some fraction of a fraction and
provide the answer as a fraction in eighths. The post had just arrived so I
flipped over an envelope and started working it out.

"Why do you need the answer in eighths?" I asked, while making calculations.

"Because I'm trying to convert a recipe and my scales only go down to eighths of an ounce."

"Why don't you just use grams?"

"…"

This reminded me of an [[https://asp-blogs.azurewebsites.net/alex_papadimoulis/408925][article]] by Alex Papadimoulis where he used the analogy of being asked whether it was better to use a bottle or a shoe to pound a nail. Although there are situations where either could be used, the real answer is, of course, to use a hammer. Sometimes we are asked questions to which we can provide an answer; but perhaps we should first stop and ask the reason for the question before answering it.

*** Lazy Questions
Let's take [[https://stackoverflow.com][StackOverflow]] as an example{{{marginnote(I'm not knocking it\, I learned to program on this site. Not by asking questions\, but through the research I did to answer questions.)}}}
The programmer's question and answer site that is also a game. 'Good' behaviour, such as asking good questions, providing helpful answers, are rewarded by upvotes, 'bad' behaviour; lazy questions, incorrect answers, are discouraged by downvotes. It is becoming increasingly common to find a Stack Overflow link as the top hit when searching the web for answers to programming questions. But, if you follow a mailing list for your chosen speciality it isn't hard to see the same question in both places and different approaches to answering them.

The site's [[https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19665/the-help-vampire-problem/19673#19673][recommended approach]] to the [[https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/][help vampires]] is a pragmatic one. Essentially, you can either be aloof and use the tools of the site to discourage the behaviour; or you could just answer the question and get some points. On a mailing list like, say, CocoaDev, a weak question will get sharp answers (if any); but on Stack Overflow, somebody might just answer the question because they get something out of it.

This might be useful to somebody. I'm sure there are times where we all just need a quick answer to question without deeper knowledge. Get help with the 'how' to get something done, and pick up on the 'why' later.  But read enough questions in public forums and you'll soon recognise those who just want to know the 'how', and no amount of saying they need to learn the basics is going to help. Maybe back up and ask why they are asking so you can better answer their question.

*** Relational vs Instrumental Understanding
 Richard Skemp{{{sidenote(Skemp\, Richard R. [Relational Understanding and Instrumental Understanding](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41182357). Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School\, vol. 12\, no. 2\, 2006\, pp. 88–95)}}}
 wrote on the difference between relational{{{sidenote(**Relational** understanding is knowing what to do and why.)}}}
 and instrumental{{{sidenote(**Instrumental** understanding is rote learning)}}}
 understanding. A particular example is how the invert and multiply method of fractional division is widely taught without actually developing an understanding of the operation itself. When I was 14 my elder brother taught me [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative][differentiation]]. Not by saying "subtract one from the exponent and multiply", but rather by drawing a curve and working through calculating a tangent using deltas and differences tending to zero and how it led to the simpler method. I've long forgotten the hard way, but after that I was very good at calculus.

Perhaps this is something to think about next time somebody asks how to write an application without using Interface Builder in Xcode.
